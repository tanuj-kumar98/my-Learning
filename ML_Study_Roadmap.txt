Adjusted Roadmap (Sept → Dec)

🔹 September – Strengthen Analyst Skills
Goal: Validate your foundation before ML gets heavy.
- SQL → Solve 40–50 problems on LeetCode (joins, subqueries, window functions).
- Excel → Do 2 business-style case studies (sales dashboard, HR attrition).
- Power BI → Build 1 polished dashboard using a Kaggle dataset (publish it).
- Python (pre-ML) → Practice with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib on small datasets.

🔹 October – Parallel Practice While Learning ML
Goal: Combine Python + Analytics + early ML.
- As your course teaches regression/classification → practice with scikit-learn.
- Do mini-projects:
  - Predict house prices (regression).
  - Predict customer churn (classification).
- Share at least 1 project per week on GitHub.
- Keep improving SQL + Power BI dashboards on different datasets.

🔹 Mid-November – Finish Course & Start Integration
Goal: Transition from learner → builder.
- Review and re-code all ML algorithms you learned.
- Build 1 end-to-end project:
  - Example: “Retail Sales Prediction Dashboard”
    - SQL → data cleaning
    - Python → ML model
    - Power BI → visualization
- Start exploring cloud basics (AWS/Azure free tier for storage + querying).

🔹 December – Portfolio & Capstone
Goal: Package your skills for recruiters.
- Do 1 big capstone project (choose a dataset you’re passionate about):
  - Example: Sentiment analysis of product reviews with ML → dashboard visualization.
- Polish your GitHub → add READMEs, clear write-ups.
- Write a “What I learned in 2025” post on LinkedIn/Medium to showcase growth.
- Optional: add beginner deep learning project (image or text classification).

🎯 By Dec 31
- You’ll have 3–4 complete projects (covering SQL, Python, ML, Power BI).
- A GitHub portfolio + LinkedIn presence.
- Confidence in both analyst + beginner ML skills.
- A clear path to target junior data scientist / data analyst with ML edge roles in 2025.
